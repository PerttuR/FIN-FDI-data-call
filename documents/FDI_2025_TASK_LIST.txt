# JCD comments

# table I+G only starts in 2015, 2013-2015 data is only used for table A (imported from SAS to Excel?)
# the current SAS extract is probably not in the correct format for the other tables
# do we need a new extract?

COMBINE 3 scripts: DONE

# JCD suggestions:
# 2013-2023 seems to be the most up-to-date file with the other 2 files being earlier versions.
# one table was renames to "*_test", perhaps we ought to change that back
# perhaps we ought to rename it back to exclude the years from the script to make it more generic
