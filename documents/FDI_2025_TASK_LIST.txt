TODO and FIX in 2025 FDI data:

ISSUE 1)
ONLY in year 2013 Table I Table G difference:
IN Table I. Effort by rectangle, variable: 21. TOTFISHDAYS: Fishing days; missing values not allowed.
IS more than 3% greater in I than in Table G 20. TOTFISHDAYS: Fishing days; ‘NK’ if the number of fishing days is not available.

Need details about is it row numberd ? or sum of all fishing days??

# JCD comments
# table I+G only starts in 2016
# table I+G do not have any missing TOTFISHDAYS

-> We need 2013 - 2015 data to fix this issue!

COMPINE 3 scripts

# JCD suggestions:
# 2013-2023 seems to be the most up-to-date file with the other 2 files being earlier versions.
# one table was renames to "*_test", perhaps we ought to change that back
# perhaps we ought to rename it back to exclude the years from the script to make it more generic
# the years could be added to the header descriptions in the script
