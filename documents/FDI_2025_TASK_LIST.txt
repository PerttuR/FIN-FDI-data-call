# Data Check ISSUES 2025 ####

# DC1 ###

Table A / Table G: no effort in G fishing days /nor seadays in certain Domains, but catches occurr in A

# DC2 ###

Table A: no value (zero) on some small catches (could be natural)

# DC3 ###

Table A some Salmon discards are higher than landings (could be natural)

# Spatial Checks ####

# DC4 ###

Table H landing values are higher than in TAble A (seems like mostly rounding?)

# DC5 ###

Total fishing days in Table I is higher than in Table G

# DC6 ###

Table H without corresponding Totfishdays in Table I



# GENERIC ISSUES

# ISSUE 0) ####

Decision: we use the file: table_a_g_h_i_j_2013-2024.R for A, G , H, I and J :) DONE

# ISSUE 1) ####
ONLY in year 2013 Table I Table G difference:
IN Table I. Effort by rectangle, variable: 21. TOTFISHDAYS: Fishing days; missing values not allowed.
IS more than 3% greater in I than in Table G 20. TOTFISHDAYS: Fishing days; ‘NK’ if the number of fishing days is not available.

Need details about is it row numberd ? or sum of all fishing days??

# JCD comments
<<<<<<< HEAD
# table I+G only starts in 2016
# table I+G do not have any missing TOTFISHDAYS

-> We need 2013 - 2015 data to fix this issue!
-> FILES are in. G:\Luke2\Stat_kala_tiedonkeruu\FDI\2023\Out

# table I+G only starts in 2015, 2013-2015 data is only used for table A (imported from SAS to Excel?)
# the current SAS extract is probably not in the correct format for the other tables

# JCD: to fully compare the differences between table I and G

# ISSUE 2) ####

2016-2023 DATA Table G
Effort (Table G) comparison issue again relating days at sea and fishing hour 2016-2023 data inside table G.

DTMT wording:
-Days at sea/
-gtdaysatsea/
-kwdaysatsea 
or/and 
-fishing days/
-gtfishdays/
-kwfishdays  reported as "0" value 

-> while hours at sea/gthrsea/kwhrsea reported

Now we have the issue DTMT text. Everybody could check it out..


# CASE 1: TOTSEADAYS and TOTFISHDAYS exist, but others are NK (most cases)
# CASE 2: HRSEA, KWHRSEA, GTHRSEA = "NK", but TOTKWDAYSATSEA, TOTGTDAYSATSEA, TOTKWFISHDAYS, TOTGTFISHDAYS contain data
# CASE 3: 16 cases where TOTGTDAYSATSEA, TOTGTFISHDAYS, HRSEA, KWHRSEA, GTHRSEA are 0

SOLUTION in FDI: 0 values mismatching other variables are set to "NK" which is ok in FDI specs.

TO DO: Track down in DCPROD: WHY missing values occurr and why they are set to 0? (Bad dates used perhaps in fec.R)
TO Do: Make imputation /or correction rules if possible in DCPROD to tackle 0 values or other missing variables

## COMBINE 3 scripts: DONE ####

# JCD suggestions:
# 2013-2023 seems to be the most up-to-date file with the other 2 files being earlier versions.
# one table was renames to "*_test", perhaps we ought to change that back
# perhaps we ought to rename it back to exclude the years from the script to make it more generic
# the years could be added to the header descriptions in the script
