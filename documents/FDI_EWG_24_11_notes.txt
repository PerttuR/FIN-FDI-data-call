Notes from FDI EWG meeting

- Value data from 2013-2015 are much lower than 2016-2023 (Perhaps thousands of Euros?)
- 2013-2015 capasity are missing inactive vessels
- Table G: Fishing days & Seadays are not complete in data from DCPROD (NK:s exist .. -> outputs look wrong in FDI Table G)
- Table G: KALASTUSAIKAHH and KALASTUSAIKAMIN Usage in Fishing hours? (KALASTUSAIKAMIN not used?) 
- Spatial data tables H and I should be from ICES VMS data call workflow.
- try Spatial checks on updates (Table H and Table I)
